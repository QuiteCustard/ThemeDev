This was a project I created in my third year of university. My assignment was to create a WordPress Theme that was suitable for a tourism and property management firm that provides a white-label website template.

## Custom controls:
- Choice of body image or colour
- Choice of header border or none
- Logo options:* custom logo* Border radius for logo * Padding for logo
- Colour options for:
  * Body
  * Header
   * Footer
   * Headings
   * Text

   * Link hovers
- Layout options for:
   * Header positioning
   * Header centred/not centred
   * Header width (1500px or full width)
   * Footer centred/not centred
   * Body width (1500px or full width)

*This is still under development*
