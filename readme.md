# Wordpress Theme Development

This was a project I created in my third year of university. My assignment was to create a WordPress Theme that was suitable for a tourism and property management firm that provides a white-label website template. The template has to be locked down as much as possible so all the sites using this template look similar.

## Custom controls:
- Choice of body image or colour
- Choice of header border or none
- Logo options:
  * Custom logo
  * Border radius for logo 
  * Padding for logo
- Colour options for:
  * Body
  * Header
  * Footer
  * Headings
  * Text
  * Links
  * Link hovers
- Layout options for:
   * Header positioning
   * Header width (1500px or full width)
   * Footer centred/not centred
   * Body width (1500px or full width)

This theme takes use of ACF and allows a restrictive content management system.

Please note that the forms displayed do not work as this was excluded from the assignment and were specified to not be done.
